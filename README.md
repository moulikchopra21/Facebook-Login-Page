This repository contains a simple implementation of a Facebook login page using HTML and CSS. It features a basic layout with fields for email/phone and password, along with a "Log In" button and links for forgotten password and account creation. The design is responsive and mimics the appearance of the Facebook login page with a clean, modern UI.
